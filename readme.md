# Project Overview  

ðŸ”— Live Demo: [Next Word Prediction App](https://deeplearningprojectnextwordprediction-etmeywdptv26l7zhxfwxca.streamlit.app/)  

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for predicting the next word in a given sequence of words. The model is built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are well-suited for sequence prediction tasks.  

## Steps  

1. **Data Collection**  
   - Used Shakespeare's *Hamlet* as the dataset.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Tokenization, sequence creation, padding, and train-test split.  

3. **Model Building**  
   - LSTM model with embedding layer, two LSTM layers, and a dense softmax output layer.  

4. **Model Training**  
   - Early stopping applied to prevent overfitting.  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated using example sentences for prediction accuracy.  

6. **Deployment**  
   - Deployed via **Streamlit web app** for real-time next-word prediction.
